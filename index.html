      <h3> The Beginning </h3>
      <p>The French Bulldog is a small breed of domestic dog. In the 1800s, they were the result of a cross between
        English Bulldogs imported from England and local ratters in Paris, France.</p>
      <h3> Popularity </h3>
      <p>
        The breed is very popular as a pet across the English-speaking world; in 2015, they were the fourth most popular
        registered dog in the United Kingdom, and in the U.S., the sixth most popular AKC-registered dog breed. They
        were rated the third most popular dog in Australia in 2017.
      </p>
      <h3> Characteristics </h3>
      <p> The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect “bat ears” that are the
        breed’s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short
        nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.</p>
